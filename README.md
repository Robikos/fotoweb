# fotoweb

This is the project created to train building apps with AngularJS frontend and using Rails as API.

Fotoweb is a service where user can upload photos as posts, creating his own photostory.
Users can like and comment posts, they can also making friendships each other to follow changes.

As the project is a training and it can be used as example of my code (AngularJS, Rails) there is not
all necessary tests. However there are controller, model RSpec tests and Capybara integration tests.

You can see old views files written both in erb and haml. That's from the first prototype of application
without AngularJS.
